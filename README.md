# lattice

Some simple lattice gauge theory projects, including an ising model, a phi^4 model, SU(2) and SU(3) pure gauge theory models, and an attempt to make an SU(3) model with dynamic fermions.

The Eigen library is needed to compile a few of these projects and is freely available at http://eigen.tuxfamily.org.
